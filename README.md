What is Shields Up?
=========================
A miniature action arcade game that focuses on blocking and parrying as its main mechanic. Players deal with waves of enemies with only a shield to defend themselves. Through blocking and parrying, the player can reflect the enemiesâ€™ attacks to defeat as many as they can before time runs out. This game is developed with Unreal Engine 4 and serves as personal project to build up my portfolio and improve my UE4 skills.

Controls
=========================
Movement - WASD
Jump - Spacebar
Camera control - Mouse movement
Blocking - Left click (and hold)
Parry - Left click (1 second window after clicking)


ShieldsUp Ver. 0.8
=========================
>There's a peculiar startup message when opening this build that only seems to appear once upon starting up but it can be ignored for the build.
>Basic controls are movement using WASD and spacebar and blocking using the left mouse button. Camera is controlled by mouse movement.
>There is one (1!) enemy that shoots thunder projectiles and empties your HP 1/10 at a time. You can parry and reflect the projectiles to damage this enemy. The enemy is destroyed in 3 hits.
>Known bugs! - Jump animation is missing, the enemy doesn't rotate until after moving to a new spot.
>Later builds will include a spawn system for the enemies, more enemies, more shields, more rewarding parry mechanics, more audio, helpful UI, game over and new level design.
