# ShieldsUp
@Kodok-ki

ShieldsUp is a small arcade-like game prototype where the player tries to survive and defeat enemie using only shields.
It by no means has the polish of a real game but is more of a pet project for me to try and recreate a game based around 
a 'parry' mechanic.

Developed with Unreal Engine 4
