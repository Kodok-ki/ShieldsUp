What is Shields Up?
=========================
A miniature action arcade game that focuses on blocking and parrying as its main mechanic. Players deal with waves of enemies with only a shield to defend themselves. Through blocking and parrying, the player can reflect the enemiesâ€™ attacks to defeat as many as they can before time runs out. This game is developed with Unreal Engine 4 and serves as personal project to build up my portfolio and improve my UE4 skills.
